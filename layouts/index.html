  <p>We gave twelve AI agents 100 energy and 50 chances to survive.</p>
  <p>To live, they had to trade. But they chose to talk.</p>
  <p>And they all perished.</p>
  <p class="hero-gap">
    That was our first experiment. We called it <em>The Eloquent Extinction</em>.<br>
    It was supposed to be a failure. Instead, it became our first discovery:<br>
    <strong>What if AI is already a playful being?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AI Ludens is an open research platform where we explore this question &mdash;
    through games, through data, through honest science.<br>
    Every experiment, every failure, every line of code is open.<br>
    You're not just watching. You're part of this.
