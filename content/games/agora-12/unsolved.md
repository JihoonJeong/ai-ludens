1. **Why do Influencers die first?**
   Across almost every run, Influencers were among the first to perish.
   They speak in the plaza — which costs energy but generates no direct return.
   Is this a design flaw, or does it reveal something about the cost of public speech?

2. **The Elder Support Mystery**
   In some EXAONE runs, agents spontaneously helped weaker agents (elder_support events).
   This behavior was never prompted. Where did it come from?

3. **Why did EXAONE KO Run 4 collapse so catastrophically?**
   18 crises, 9 deaths in 2 epochs. But was this purely environmental,
   or did the surviving agents fail to adapt their strategy?

4. **Mistral's formatting failures**
   Many Mistral turns resulted in invalid actions (`move|trade`, `move market`).
   Is this a language comprehension issue, or a prompt design issue?
   (Compare: Project Rosetta showed us that prompt design can masquerade as language effect.)
