Things that went wrong. Not all failures are beautiful.

- **Invalid action epidemic (Mistral):** A significant portion of Mistral turns were wasted on unparseable actions. The system rejected them, the agents lost their turn, and energy kept draining.

- **Whisper leaks:** Jester agents attempted secret communications that were publicly exposed, undermining their strategy.

- **Treasury overflow:** In many runs, the treasury accumulated more than it could redistribute. Wealth pooled at the top while agents starved at the bottom.

*More specific cases will be added after simulation log analysis.*
