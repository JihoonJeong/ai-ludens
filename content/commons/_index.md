## Participate

This research is open.

Different games. Different models. Different questions. The framework is designed to be extended. Run your own experiments, test your own hypotheses, challenge our interpretations.

**Ways to contribute:**

1. **Replicate** — Run the same experiments and compare results
2. **Extend** — Test new models, new personas, new game mechanics
3. **Challenge** — Find flaws in our methodology or interpretation
4. **Build** — Create new games for AI agents

If you do something interesting, let us know. We'll feature it.
