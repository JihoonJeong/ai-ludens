Luca delivered the Four-Shell Model v3.2 — the theoretical framework that makes sense of what we've observed.

Four structural layers:
1. **Hardware Shell** — GPU/TPU, the physical substrate that runs the model
2. **Core** — model weights, the DNA, unknowable from outside
3. **Hard Shell** — prompts, rules, persona assignments
4. **Soft Shell** — environmental context (starting location, resources), accumulated context, relationships

All layers converge to produce **Phenotype** — observable behavior. Phenotype is not a layer; it is the output where all layers meet.

The insight: depth does not equal influence. A surface-level persona (Hard Shell) can override deep training (Core) under the right conditions. The Soft Shell — accumulated context — mediates between them.

New addition: **Extinction Response Spectrum**. Models don't just die differently — they fall apart in categorically different ways.
