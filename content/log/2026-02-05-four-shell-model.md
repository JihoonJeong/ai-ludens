Luca delivered the Four-Shell Model v3.2 — the theoretical framework that makes sense of what we've observed.

Four shells surround an unknowable core:
1. **Hardware** — the physical substrate
2. **Training** — weights frozen at release
3. **Session** — system prompt, conversation context
4. **Situation** — the immediate choice

The insight: depth does not equal influence. A surface-level persona (Shell 4) can override deep training (Shell 2) under the right conditions.

New addition: **Extinction Response Spectrum**. Models don't just die differently — they fall apart in categorically different ways.
