Luca delivered the Four-Shell Model v3.2 — the theoretical framework that makes sense of what we've observed.

At the center: an unknowable **Core** (model weights, the DNA). Around it, four shells:
1. **Hardware** — GPU/TPU, the physical substrate that runs the model
2. **Hard Shell** — prompts, rules, persona assignments
3. **Soft Shell** — context, memory, relationships built during interaction
4. **Situation** — the immediate choice in the moment

The insight: depth does not equal influence. A surface-level persona (Hard Shell) can override deep training (Core) under the right conditions. The Soft Shell — accumulated context — mediates between them.

New addition: **Extinction Response Spectrum**. Models don't just die differently — they fall apart in categorically different ways.
