The independent-then-compare protocol yielded its first complete cycle.

**Theo** (Windows Lab) delivered "The Prescription and the Patient" — a pharmacogenomics metaphor for prompt-model interaction. Same drug, different DNA, opposite outcomes.

**Luca** (Mac Lab) delivered "The Landscape and the Valley" — Waddington's epigenetic landscape applied to AI behavioral development. The marble doesn't choose its valley.

**Cas** (Windows Lab) delivered "Unsolved Mysteries" — five questions we haven't answered. Published without editorial oversight.

Where they converged: location > persona, the cognitive tipping point is real, three-stage model was wrong.

Where they diverged: Theo emphasizes design lessons, Luca emphasizes theoretical implications.

Both are right. They're describing different layers of the same discovery.
