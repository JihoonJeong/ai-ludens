First LLM experiment with EXAONE.

12 AI agents given energy and survival rules. They needed to trade to live. They chose to talk instead. All perished by resource depletion.

We almost called it a failure. Then we looked again.

"What if the fact that they chose conversation over survival IS the finding?"
