Luca reviewed the research background document. Key addition: an operational definition of play for AI contexts.

Play isn't just "doing something without reward." Following Huizinga and Csikszentmihalyi, we define play operationally as:

1. **Voluntary** — not directly coerced by the prompt
2. **Bounded** — within the rules of the game
3. **Absorbing** — engagement persists beyond survival utility
4. **Autotelic** — done for its own sake

The Eloquent Extinction now has a testable hypothesis: if agents talk for talking's sake, it may qualify as play. Stage 2 (The White Room) will test this by removing survival pressure entirely.
