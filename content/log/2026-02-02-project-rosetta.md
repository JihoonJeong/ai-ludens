description: "The language effect was a prompt design artifact"
---

Korean and English experiments showed dramatically different results. Korean agents: total extinction. English agents: 58% survival.

We celebrated: "Language shapes AI behavior!"

Then we checked the prompts. The English version had more survival guidance. The "language effect" was a prompt design artifact.

Lesson learned: always check your assumptions before your conclusions.
